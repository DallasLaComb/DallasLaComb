## Dallas LaComb, Computer Science Senior Student at Central Connecticut State University

- I’m currently working on a project called Mon Ecole. This will be a way for countries who can't afford blackboard or powerschool to allow their students to have digital records of their schooling. I am helping make the start of this project, the tech stack is Mongo, Express, React, and Node.
- I’m currently learning MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Nodes.js, and Kotlin.
