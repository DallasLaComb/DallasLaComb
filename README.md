# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Dallas LaComb

I'm a Senior Computer Science Student at Central Connecticut State University with a passion for technology and innovation. I'm on the lookout for a 2024 tech internship that allows me to dive deeper into software development, data engineering, web development, mobile app development, artificial intelligence, or cyber security. I currently have had the most experience with web and mobile app developments with higher level programming languages, but I'm open to different opportunites and learning new things.
## ðŸŒŸ Projects
### Flag Bingo for CCSU Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean Center
Developed an interactive Flag Bingo web application (accessible at [sites.ccsu.edu/flagbingo/](https://sites.ccsu.edu/flagbingo/). Created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and cookies, this platform engages users in learning country names and flags. 
### Mon-Ecole - Digital Education Records
I'm currently contributing to a project named **Mon Ecole**, aiming to spread access to digital education records in African countries where resources like blackboard or powerschool are scarce. This project is being built with a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and reflects my commitment to using technology for social good.
### Ticket Master - Ticket Browsing and Bookmarking
Developed a ticket browsing and bookmarking website, accessible at [dallaslacomb.pythonanywhere.com/](https://dallaslacomb.pythonanywhere.com/)
which utilizes the Ticketmaster API to dynamically fetch and display current tickets available for events.
This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Django, and SQLite for the database. Users can
search for events, such as 'Music' in 'Hartford', and bookmark tickets of interest for later viewing on the
bookmarks page.
### PrivacyPulse - Encrypted Note System
Developed an encrypted note application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Node.js, Express, and a
Firebase database. Implemented hashing for user passwords. The application generates a private key
locally on the user's device upon registration. The app utilizasymmetric encryption to encrypt notes with
the user's public key before transmission to the database, and private key for decryption.
## ðŸ›  Skills
Below are some of the technologies I've worked with, rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (ðŸŒŸ) based on my proficiency:

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.**

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ**JavaScript, jQuery, Python, and Django.**

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ**PostgreSQL, Node.js, SQLite, Express.js, and Kotlin.**

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ**AWS, React.js, and Java.**

ðŸŒŸ**C and MIPS Assembly**

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing my experiences with these technologies or how I've applied them in various projects.
