I'm on the lookout for a 2024 tech internship that allows me to dive deeper into software development, data engineering, web development, mobile app development, artificial intelligence, or cyber security. I currently have had the most experience with web and mobile app developments with higher level programming languages, but I'm open to different opportunites and learning new things.
