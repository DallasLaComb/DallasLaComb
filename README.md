# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Dallas LaComb

I'm a Senior Computer Science Student at Central Connecticut State University with a passion for technology and innovation.
## ðŸŒŸ Projects
### Flag Bingo for CCSU Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean Center
Developed an interactive Flag Bingo web application (accessible at [sites.ccsu.edu/flagbingo/](https://sites.ccsu.edu/flagbingo/). Created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and cookies, this platform engages users in learning country names and flags. 
### Ticket Master - Django Web App - Web Development Final Project
Developed a ticket browsing and bookmarking website, accessible at [dallaslacomb.pythonanywhere.com/](https://dallaslacomb.pythonanywhere.com/)
which utilizes the Ticketmaster API to dynamically fetch and display current tickets available for events.
This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, Django, and SQLite for the database. Users can
search for events, such as 'Music' in 'Hartford', and bookmark tickets of interest for later viewing on the
bookmarks page.
### Ticket Master - Kotlin / Android Studio, Mobile App
