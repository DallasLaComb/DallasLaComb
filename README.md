# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Dallas LaComb

I'm a Senior Computer Science Student at Central Connecticut State University with a passion for technology and innovation. I'm on the lookout for a 2024 tech internship that allows me to dive deeper into software development, data engineering, web development, mobile app development, artificial intelligence, or cyber security. I currently have had the most experience with web and mobile app developments with higher level programming languages, but I'm open to different opportunites and learning new things.
## ðŸŒŸ Projects
### Flag Bingo for CCSU Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean Center
Developed an interactive Flag Bingo web application (accessible at [sites.ccsu.edu/flagbingo/](https://sites.ccsu.edu/flagbingo/). Created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and cookies, this platform engages users in learning country names and flags. 
### Mon Ecole
I'm currently contributing to a project named **Mon Ecole**, aiming to spread access to digital education records in African countries where resources like blackboard or powerschool are scarce. This project is being built with a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and reflects my commitment to using technology for social good.
### Ticket Master Django
